          Designed an application prototype for a concept of an application idea
          involving hobbies. The idea for the application is a platform that can
          help users learn about their favorite hobbies and interact with the
          communities through the application. The design was created using
          Adobe XD and Photoshop.

          Utilized JavaScript React library to transform a design created
          through the prototyping software, Figma, into a fully functioning
          website. The webpage will display on most devices because of the
          adaptive media queries used to style it.

          Created a website design for a concept of an application idea
          involving different music genres and their respective art styles. In
          this project, I utilized Wordpress to design the interface of the
          application. For creative assets, I utilized Adobe Photoshop and
          Illustrator to create logos and mockups that are used throughout the
          design.

          Developed a 2D platformer video game using GDevelop game engine. I
          created all the art assets used in the game with programs such as
          Aseprite for pixel art and Photoshop for general art. There is also
          music that was created by using the digital audio workstation,
          Ableton, to create a soundtrack for the video game.

          Created a blog web page design using HTML and CSS. There were media
          queries utilized so that the page can be scaled and read on other
          devices such as mobile.I experimented with multiple versions of
          features such as buttons to make it accessible to a wide range of
          people.
